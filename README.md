# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# Integrating RWA with ERC 404 for conditional changes:

A new business model can work on the basis of RWA and ERC 404 where Real-world assets can be changed to fungible based on some conditions.
For example: A RWA based product can be changed to fungible from non-fungible after some one buys it, to provide the exchangable(swapping) functionality on chain. ERC 404 has the power to make RWAs condtional exchangable and thus providing a fully decentralized DeFi Platform for consumer sectors such as eCommerce.s
